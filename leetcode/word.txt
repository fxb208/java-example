Group Replication ensures that a transaction only commits after a majority of the members in a group have received it and agreed on the relative order between all transactions that were sent concurrently. This approach works well if the total number of writes to the group does not exceed the write capacity of any member in the group. If it does and some of the members have less write throughput than others, particularly less than the writer members, those members can start lagging behind of the writers

MySQL Group Replication enables you to create elastic, highly-available, fault-tolerant replication topologies

As distributed systems become increasingly popular, the reliability between services is becoming more important than ever before. Sentinel takes "flow" as breakthrough point, and works on multiple fields including flow control, traffic shaping, circuit breaking and system adaptive protection, to guarantee reliability and resilience for microservices

ZooKeeper does not guarantee that at every instance in time, two different clients will have identical views of ZooKeeper data. Due to factors like network delays, one client may perform an update before another client gets notified of the change. Consider the scenario of two clients, A and B. If client A sets the value of a znode /a from 0 to 1, then tells client B to read /a, client B may read the old value of 0, depending on which server it is connected to. If it is important that Client A and Client B read the same value, Client B should call the sync() method from the ZooKeeper API method before it performs its read. So, ZooKeeper by itself doesn't guarantee that changes occur synchronously across all servers, but ZooKeeper primitives can be used to construct higher level functions that provide useful client synchronization
